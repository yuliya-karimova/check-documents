If not saved, it only displays the call number, which matches part of the requirement in Text_SSTS.\\n\\nStep 4: Compare the sound and music control behavior of the Short HMI with the requirements.\\nThe Text_SSTS requires that an incoming call sound is played through vehicle's speakers. The Short HMI mentions playing an incoming ringtone through speakers, but it does not explicitly state whether this ringtone comes from the mobile phone or the IVI default ringtone.\\n\\nStep 5: Evaluate the exit conditions and postconditions of the Short HMI in relation to Text_SSTS.\\nThe Short HMI describes exit conditions such as accepting/rejecting calls using steering wheel buttons or voice assistant commands, BT connection loss, or switching off.
